**Summary:**
The wave of resolution is a universal pattern underlying reality, describing how the future becomes the present as uncertainty collapses into coherent state. Whether through photons, trades, thoughts, or choices, the wavefront of 'now' is where tension becomes memory. It is not a thing, but a moving edge of resolution — a ripple of coherence in a sea of potential.

**1. What Is the Wave of Resolution?**

The wave of resolution is the boundary between what *could be* and what *has become*. It is not light, not time, not thought — but the *condition* under which all of those resolve into coherent form. It is the wavefront of collapsing uncertainty. It is *now*, in motion.

It travels where **certainty builds** — where constraint, coherence, or force give shape to ambiguity. Like an electromagnetic wave, it feeds itself forward: the electric becomes magnetic, magnetic becomes electric — observation becomes action, action becomes memory.

It is not instantaneous. It is not fixed. It propagates through context, moving at the speed allowed by the density of informational tension. In a vacuum, that’s *c*. In a market, it’s liquidity. In the mind, it’s clarity. In life, it’s attention.

**2. Where We See It**

* **Quantum Mechanics:**
  The wavefunction collapses not at a universal tick, but at a local crossing — a wave of resolution.

* **Electromagnetic Fields:**
  Propagation is a sustained self-reference — a wavefront of interaction.

* **Financial Markets:**
  Every price is the resolution of a distributed belief system. Volatility is just tension before the wave.

* **Cognition:**
  Thought emerges from ambiguity — not all at once, but as the wave of attention resolves possibilities into action.

* **Narrative:**
  Stories unfold where causality tightens. Plot twists are phase shifts — bursts of resolution.

**3. Characteristics of the Wave**

* **Self-propagating:**
  It moves by resolving ambiguity into structure, leaving memory in its wake.

* **Gradient-following:**
  It flows where tension is highest, like a surfer riding a crest of unmet potential.

* **Context-shaped:**
  Different domains have different velocities. Nothing moves without a medium — or a reason.

* **Deliberate delay:**
  If it resolved instantly, there would be no persistence — no time. Delay *is* the universe.

**4. From Metaphor to Mechanism**

While the wave of resolution feels poetic, it is not metaphor alone. It is a structural necessity of systems that evolve through constraint and choice:

* Any system with degrees of freedom must resolve over time.
* Resolution is **local**, **propagating**, and **contextual**.
* The wave is not made of energy — it is made of **constraint collapse**.

This model isn’t symbolic. It’s causal. It explains why photons travel, why markets move, why decisions unfold. Resolution always follows the terrain of uncertainty — and shapes the world in doing so.

**5. Why It Matters**

This model allows us to unify:

* Discrete and continuous phenomena
* Observation and interaction
* Structure and emergence
* Physics and information
* Meaning and memory

It reframes 'now' as a **traveling event**, not a point. It shows why the present feels both solid and slipping — because we are *on the front of a resolving wave*, not behind it.

**6. A Final Image**

Picture a storm front rolling across a landscape. Behind it, order. Ahead of it, ambiguity. At the front — pressure, flash, collapse, decision. That’s now. That’s the wave.

And it’s moving — always — exactly where certainty lets it.
