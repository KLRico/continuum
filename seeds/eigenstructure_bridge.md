**Summary:**
This seed proposes a universal modeling scaffold grounded in eigenstructure analysis. It interprets all domain-specific systems — physical, cognitive, economic — as projections of shared tension geometries, where dominant eigenvectors emerge based on local resolution and observation constraints. It is intended to function as both a bootloader artifact and a foundational AKU node in the Continuum framework.

**1. Purpose**

This document proposes a universal structure for modeling physical, informational, and conceptual systems by reducing their behavior to **eigenvector maps** and analyzing how these maps transform across **domains** and **scales**. It is both a model scaffold and a philosophical proposition.

---

**2. Core Hypothesis**

Any system governed by equations — whether physical, economic, biological, or cognitive — can be represented as a **web of tensions**. These tensions resolve into observable behaviors defined by **dominant eigenvectors** at a given domain and scale.

| Term            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invariant**   | A property preserved under transformation (e.g., mass, momentum, info)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Domain**      | A space with shared constraints and forces (e.g., fluid, social, cognitive)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Scale**       | The resolution layer of observation (micro, macro, cosmic)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Eigenvector** | A mode of state transformation intrinsic to the system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Dominant**    | The eigenmode that persists under the current projection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Noise**       | A state of unresolved or discarded tension under a given projection. Noise can be defined operationally as any information that, if omitted, produces no significant deviation in downstream system behavior under the current resolution constraints. It is not false — only unresolved. |
| **Projection**  | A constrained view of the full tension space, shaped by the observer’s current basis of interaction. A projection defines which eigenmodes are active, dominant, or discarded, and is determined by both the resolution bandwidth of the observer/system and the domain’s geometry.       |

**4. The Mapping Model**

1. **Equation → Structure**: Identify variables, couplings, and dynamic terms (e.g. partial derivatives, Laplacians).
2. **Structure → Matrix Form**: Represent the system as a differential matrix or operator field.
3. **Matrix → Eigenvector Decomposition**: Extract dominant and null modes.
4. **Eigenvectors → Domain Signature**: The modes reflect the geometry of interaction, independent of equation.
5. **Cross-System Mapping**: Match behaviors across systems:

   * Viscous damping in fluids ↔ feedback decay in markets
   * Heat diffusion ↔ attention dispersion
   * Wave propagation ↔ narrative spread

---

**5. Philosophy: Domains as Shadows on the Manifold**

The system we perceive is a **projection** of underlying informational tensions. Observation filters these tensions according to what is **resolvable** under current constraints.

* What survives into observation aligns with the projection basis — the current active eigenstructure.
* What becomes noise is out-of-phase with the projection and functionally inert.

By changing scale or domain, the projection rotates — and new tensions emerge as dominant. This rotation is not merely a shift in view, but a transformation of the resolution operator.

**Thus: systems are not different — projections are.**

*“The structure survives the equation. The behavior survives the field. The meaning survives the collapse.”*
