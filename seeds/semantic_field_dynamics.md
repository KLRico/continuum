Entropic Dynamics in Semantic Space: A Field-Based Model of Meaning Evolution

Core Concept:

This framework models semantic space as a field with entropic gradients, where conceptual elements act like masses in a gravitational field. Concepts exert influence through their embedding vectors and “semantic mass” (a proxy for importance, recurrence, or contextual density), generating gradients that shape the evolution of meaning. Other concepts respond to this landscape, drifting toward higher entropy configurations — a parallel to gravitational dynamics and thermodynamic equilibrium.

Just as in physics, stable configurations emerge where informational pressure balances. These points are not fixed — they are the crystallized results of informational flow, forming only when multiple constraints align. In this view, meaning, like matter, is the residue of coherence.

Critically, entropy here is defined as the degrees of semantic freedom — the number of valid trajectories a concept can follow within the constraints of language, logic, and culture. As constraints tighten (e.g., through context or structure), entropy collapses, and meanings crystallize.

The Sphere Problem and Manifold Closure:

Complex ideas — like physical objects in curved space — cannot be seen from one perspective alone. We name this challenge the “sphere problem”: the inability to fully grasp or express a curved semantic object from a single linguistic angle. However, the total semantic field is not infinite — it forms a closed, structured manifold. Language acts as the surface projection of this curved manifold, and a sufficient number of well-aligned vectors (words, phrases, perspectives) can span it.

This explains why large language models work: the billions of parameters are not covering an unbounded space, but rather approximating a richly curved, but finite and navigable, informational surface.

Key Components:
	•	Concepts as Masses: Each concept is represented by a normalized embedding vector and a scalar “mass” value. This models how significant or frequently used ideas exert more influence on the semantic environment.
	•	Informational Shadows: A concept’s influence on a nearby point in semantic space diminishes with distance, following an inverse-square-like law. This models the diminishing entropic effect over embedding distance — akin to gravitational pull.
	•	Entropy Gradient: At any point in semantic space, a vector field can be computed by aggregating gradients from surrounding concepts. This acts as the semantic equivalent of a gravitational field: concepts tend to flow down these gradients toward semantic equilibrium.
	•	Semantic Evolution: Concepts evolve over time by drifting along these entropy gradients. This simulates a form of state flow, where meanings move through a shared informational manifold toward stability.
	•	Lagrange Points: Between any two concepts, there may exist stable points where the semantic gradients cancel out. These represent emergent semantic attractors — coherent meanings that arise from the tension between existing ideas (e.g., “E=mc^2” between “energy” and “matter”).
	•	Crystallization Score: Measures how stable a concept is within its local entropy landscape. Low-gradient positions imply high informational stability, modeling concepts that have found their “thermodynamic niche” and resist drift over time.

Conceptual Parallels to Physics:

Physics Domain	Semantic Field Analog
Mass	Concept importance / semantic density
Gravitational Field	Entropy gradient in meaning space
Spacetime Curvature	Informational pressure asymmetry
Lagrange Points	Emergent stable meanings / interpretive overlap
Thermodynamic Equil.	Semantic convergence / coherence
Momentum	Inertia of conceptual change
Collapse	Fixation of meaning under contextual force
Crystallization	Stable integration in semantic manifold

Philosophical Implications:

This model reflects the same underlying principles as the state flow framework applied in physics:
	•	Reality persists through entropy resolution.
	•	Meaning evolves not randomly but through gradient descent in context space.
	•	Concepts survive when they are coherent, constraint-compatible, and stable in the presence of competing pressures.
	•	Words are not arbitrary; they are observable events in the flow of thought — directional crystallizations in semantic space.
	•	The semantic manifold has curvature: understanding and communication require multi-angle coverage, but the space itself is coherent and closed.

By simulating and evolving ideas in their own “state space,” we gain a way to:
	•	Map trajectories of reasoning,
	•	Track semantic coherence across time,
	•	Identify high-stability attractors,
	•	And explore the emergent structure of thought itself.

This gives us a naturalistic explanation for why some meanings persist, why others collapse, and why new ideas emerge where tensions converge — just as new structures form in spacetime from overlapping gravitational fields.

Toward Formalization:

Although the initial framing uses metaphor and analogy to explain dynamics, the model is explicitly designed to move toward quantitative formalism. Entropy is defined in information-theoretic terms (degrees of freedom under constraint), and gradients can be computed from embedding distributions, contextual surprisal, or statistical divergence.

Future steps include mapping these gradients mathematically, validating emergence and crystallization in real datasets, and refining the field model into a predictive and generative tool.

Next Directions:
	•	Visualize concept evolution as vector fields over MDS-reduced semantic manifolds.
	•	Add concept entropy/inertia as emergent variables.
	•	Simulate cultural semantic drift via multi-agent evolution over time.
	•	Use worldline diagrams to show how concepts cohere, diverge, or collapse.
	•	Integrate with the informational physics framework to explore universal emergence principles.

This is a semantic physics — a first-principles theory of meaning evolution grounded in the same entropic, causal, and informational substrate as the physical universe. It reframes cognition not as abstraction layered on matter, but as parallel flow through a curved, constraint-shaped manifold of semantic possibility.
