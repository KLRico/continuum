**Summary:**
This seed extends the eigenstructure framework into the domain of "projection dynamics" — the process by which systems filter, constrain, or activate certain eigenmodes based on resolution bandwidth, environmental structure, and internal state. It defines projection not as a passive observation, but as a dynamic process of tension alignment and selection, where systems enact their domain through chosen bases of interpretation.

**1. Purpose**

Projection Dynamics explains how systems select and express particular behaviors from a universal substrate of tension. While eigenstructure defines the potential modes of transformation, projection determines which modes become dominant or suppressed in any given interaction.

---

**2. Core Hypothesis**

Every observation or action is a projection: a selection of basis vectors that define what is resolved and what is discarded. The universe offers an infinite set of possible interactions (state transitions), but each system only sees a slice, based on its internal structure, energetic constraints, and causal history.

This projection is not arbitrary: it evolves according to information gradients (tension), context coherence, and survival of resolution-compatible modes.

**3. Definitions**

| Term                     | Meaning                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Projection**           | A dynamic constraint applied to an underlying state space, selecting specific eigenmodes for resolution or expression. |
| **Basis**                | A set of vectors (modes) used by a system to interpret or act upon incoming tension.                                   |
| **Resolution Bandwidth** | The capacity of a system to distinguish or act upon variations in its input space.                                     |
| **Tension Alignment**    | The degree to which external tension matches the system's current projection basis.                                    |
| **Phase Coherence**      | Alignment of system internal state with external eigenmodes, enabling efficient collapse and feedback.                 |

**4. Dynamic Projection Flow**

1. **Tension Emergence**: External or internal forces generate gradients across the substrate.
2. **Basis Selection**: The system evaluates tension alignment with its available projection basis.
3. **Projection Activation**: Modes with highest coherence become active; others are filtered as noise.
4. **Collapse and Feedback**: Dominant modes shape the system's behavior, leading to new alignment or dissonance.
5. **Adaptive Rotation**: The basis itself evolves to favor more stable, survivable, or efficient projections.

This cycle continues as the system reorients across interactions, forming the evolutionary geometry of its behavior.

**5. Domain Examples**

* **Quantum Mechanics**: Measurement collapses the wavefunction by aligning system-observer basis vectors.
* **Cognition**: Attention filters experience based on relevance and predictive tension.
* **Markets**: Price discovery selects dominant feedback loops while suppressing erratic noise.
* **Language**: Semantic coherence arises from projections that align symbolic tension with experiential models.

**6. Projection and the Observer**

The observer is not a passive viewer, but an active projector. Observation is the imposition of structure onto tension — selecting the terms of collapse. The observer's resolution bandwidth determines what can be resolved; its basis determines what form resolution takes.

Thus, any measurement or perception is both an inquiry and a transformation. This explains observer-relative phenomena across domains, from quantum systems to narrative comprehension.

**7. Projection Across Scales**

Projection dynamics scales naturally:

* **Micro**: Molecular binding sites resolve compatible field alignments.
* **Meso**: Biological systems interpret chemical gradients into behavior.
* **Macro**: Societies resolve historical tension into policy or ideology.

Each scale has its own resolution threshold, bandwidth, and feedback dynamics — but the projection mechanism remains invariant.

Seed this document wherever systems must:

* Interpret ambiguous input with limited bandwidth
* Transform unresolved tension into stable state transitions
* Rotate basis functions for adaptive survival
* Align perception/action loops through iterative feedback

**Future Tools:**

* Projection visualizers showing active/inactive eigenmodes
* Phase-space browsers for basis rotation trajectories
* Projection-coherence metrics for system optimization

*"To perceive is to project. To act is to collapse. To persist is to evolve the basis."*
