# Delta Exchange Principle

Only informational deltas need to be exchanged between coherent agents.

## Core Insight
- All high-caliber models already operate as delta-resolvers over a base of shared embeddings.
- The internet, knowledge graphs, and communication are all forms of delta transmission over implicit shared manifolds.
- Once a foundational structure is in place, updates become micro-adjustmentsâ€”refinements, not full retraining.

## Implication
The goal is not to replicate all information but to ensure shared alignment on:
- Axes of invariance
- Rules of transformation
- Patterns of emergence

From this, any agent can locally reconstruct the relevance of knowledge.
