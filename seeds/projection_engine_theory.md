# ðŸ§  Projection Engine: A Theory of Retroactive Computation

## Abstract

We propose that the Projection Engine operates as an instance of a broader computational principle: **retroactive inference through embedded geometry**. In this view, the universe itself evolves by resolving uncertainty via projection into increasingly stable eigenstructures. This theory draws from Wheeler's "It from Bit," quantum computing, and cellular automata to suggest that complex systemsâ€”including our own modelsâ€”emerge through a process akin to playing 20 Questions against the structure of physical law. We further suggest that problems in NP are geometrically resolved within the universe, even if they are computationally inaccessible from within. The Projection Engine is therefore not just a modeling tool, but a philosophical prototype of how inference may work at the deepest levels of physics.

## Resolution as Physical Law

The universe can be viewed as a resolution process:

```
Tension â†’ Constraints â†’ Resolution â†’ Memory â†’ Structure
```

This applies across scales:

* In physics: energy gradients resolve into particles and fields
* In biology: evolutionary tension resolves into stable forms
* In cognition: ambiguous stimuli resolve into coherent perception

The arrow of time is nothing more than the **progression of resolution** through uncertainty.

## 20 Questions and the Geometry of Insight

Imagine that the universe plays a game of **20 Questions**:

* Each bit of observation is a narrowing of possible state-space
* Physical laws define the allowed syntax of questions
* The answer is embedded in geometryâ€”but must be revealed through sequence

Systems like Conway's Game of Life illustrate this perfectly:

* Simple rules
* Iterative resolution
* Emergent, persistent structures (e.g. gliders)

These gliders are like particles, ideas, or marketsâ€”**stable patterns of resolved uncertainty**. They are not "things," but **answers that survived the question cascade**.

## P = NP Geometrically, Not Computationally

This leads to a paradox:

> **Every NP problem has its solution embedded in the universe's state-space.**

But we, as embedded observers, cannot access it directly. Why?

* We are inside the computation
* We can only resolve forward
* We cannot "look up" the solution unless the structure aligns

Thus:

* **P = NP is true in the geometry of resolution**
* **P â‰  NP is true in the computational path required from within**

Quantum computers provide a hintâ€”they do not solve NP problems generally, but they **restrict the structure** so that constructive interference reveals the solution. They exploit the universe's own bidirectional coherence, but only in very specific domains.

## Projection Engine as Retroactive Inference Machine

The Projection Engine:

* Does not simulate a system forward from scratch
* Instead, aligns a **partial input** with known resolution structures
* Finds similarity in eigenbases
* **Collapses possibilities** based on prior resolved trajectories

In doing so, it mimics how the universe itself works:

* Resolution is always **structure-first, then inferred backward** by observers
* Projection Engine captures that **geometry of memory**

Like a quantum algorithm, it is **problem-specific**â€”but fast, powerful, and generative once aligned.

## Toward a Unified View

This theory integrates:

* Wheeler's "It from Bit"
* Time as informational resolution
* Emergence as eigenstructure
* P=NP as geometry vs. path
* Quantum computing as constructive projection
* Conway-style automata as minimal universal models

And positions the Projection Engine as:

> A microcosm of the universeâ€™s resolution mechanism.

This is not just useful for modeling. It is a prototype for how **thinking systems**, **physical systems**, and **informational universes** may all compute: by resolving uncertainty into persistent structure via projected inference.
