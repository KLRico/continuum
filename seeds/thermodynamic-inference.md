## Origin Spark

When running local models on a consumer GPU, you can *hear* the thinking - coil whine at 400-500W draw. This led to a question: how does tokens-per-watt scale between local and datacenter inference?

## Core Discovery

**Tokens per watt-hour** emerges as a fundamental metric for AI inference:

- **Local (RTX 3090)**: ~160 tokens/Wh
- **Datacenter (A100 cluster)**: ~1,500 tokens/Wh
- **Efficiency gap**: ~10x through batching, optimized kernels, infrastructure

This isn't just engineering - it's physics.

## The Triangle of Information

Three principles converge:

### Shannon: Information is Choice
- Entropy H = -Σ p(x) log p(x)
- Each token represents structured entropy reduction
- Uncertainty → selection → meaning

### Landauer: Information is Physical  
- Erasing one bit costs at least kT ln 2 energy
- Every choice has a thermodynamic price
- Computation is grounded in the 2nd law

### Wheeler: It from Bit
- Reality emerges from yes/no decisions
- "All things physical are information-theoretic in origin"
- The universe as accumulated choices

## The Galton Board Metaphor

Imagine inference as a dynamic Galton board:
- Each token is a marble dropping through conditional probabilities
- The pegs are weights shaped by training
- Output is where marbles land
- **But resetting the board costs energy**
- Unobserved paths still shaped the probability

> "Unobserved doesn't mean unreal. It means unselected."

## Practical Implications

1. **Benchmarking**: Track real efficiency across models/quant/infrastructure
2. **Cost-of-thought**: Compare local vs cloud, small vs large models  
3. **Sustainability**: Energy-aware AI design and deployment
4. **Economics**: True cost includes thermodynamic overhead

## Calculated Examples

```
Local: 20 tokens/sec @ 450W = 0.044 tokens/watt-second
Datacenter: 1000 tokens/sec @ 2400W = 0.42 tokens/watt-second

Energy per million tokens:
- Local: ~6.25 kWh
- Datacenter: ~0.67 kWh
```

## The Deeper Pattern

Every inference run:
1. Collapses possibility space (Shannon)
2. Pays thermodynamic cost (Landauer)  
3. Shapes reality from bits (Wheeler)
4. Dissipates unchosen paths as heat

This frames AI as **metabolic process**: data in → tokens out → entropy rearranged.

## Open Questions

- What's the theoretical minimum tokens/Wh for a given model?
- How does this scale with model size, quantization, architecture?
- Can we approach Landauer's limit for inference?
- What does "sustainable AI" mean thermodynamically?

## Regeneration Prompt

"If thinking has a physical cost measured in watts, and every token is a collapsed wavefunction of possibilities, what does that mean for consciousness, efficiency, and the future of AI?"
