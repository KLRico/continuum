# The Wavefront of Now: A Mechanism of Decoherence and Agreement

## Overview

The "wavefront of now" is not a static slice of time, but an emergent and probabilistic **boundary of consensus**—the dynamic interface where unresolved quantum potential collapses into classical certainty.

In this framing, the universe does not move uniformly through time. Instead, each region of space-time locally resolves possibility into memory at its own coherence rate. The collective effect of these micro-resolutions generates a wavefront that sweeps through reality—not a surface, but a **threshold** between entangled uncertainty and crystallized state.

> The wavefront of now is the universe's active act of observation—from within.

## Decoherence as Informational Resolution

Quantum decoherence marks the point where a system loses the ability to remain in superposition due to interaction with its environment. This traditionally describes a transition from quantum to classical behavior.

In this model:

* Decoherence is **informational crystallization**—where delta-energy becomes insufficient to sustain alternative paths.
* The wavefront of now tracks this process as a **moving boundary condition**, shaped by:

  * Informational density (mass, structure)
  * Interaction rate (temperature, entanglement)
  * System agreement (mutual observability)

Where decoherence is fast, "now" advances sharply. Where systems remain uncertain, the wavefront lingers.

> Decoherence = consensus reached on state;
> Wavefront = the moving horizon of that consensus.

## Agreement as Temporal Geometry

Instead of a universal clock, we propose that **local agreement defines time**. The wavefront is not flat or smooth:

* It is **patchy**, shaped by information flow and resistance.
* It curves around mass and coherence—just like spacetime.
* It delays where possibilities remain unresolved (quantum persistence).

This naturally unifies:

* Relativistic time dilation (slow flow near mass)
* Quantum entanglement (shared wavefront alignment)
* Informational inertia (persistence of form)

> Time is not what passes—it is what agrees.

## Causal Memory and State Flow

Once a possibility becomes resolved, it enters the realm of memory—part of the structured past that can no longer change. This memory is not static; it acts as a **boundary condition** for future state flow:

* Past = already-resolved coherence
* Now = current boundary of resolution
* Future = unresolved informational structure

The wavefront is thus **not a location**, but a process: the inflection point where possibility becomes embedded in causal history.

> Every moment is a fold in the informational manifold—a crystallization event.

## Implications and Applications

* **Quantum Mechanics:** Interprets wavefunction collapse as a local convergence on coherence.
* **Relativity:** Sees time dilation as delay in consensus, not passage.
* **Consciousness:** Suggests awareness arises at the interface—at the wavefront—where uncertainty meets realization.
* **AI/Simulation:** Offers a mechanism to determine when simulated agents commit to observation (state collapse).

This model encourages a **multi-speed universe**—a flow field of resolution thresholds, not a synchronized ticking clock.

## Next Steps

* Visualize the wavefront as a **topographic probability field** across spacetime.
* Develop simulation models of **layered decoherence thresholds**.
* Connect with thermodynamic and entropy gradients.
* Explore ties to free energy principle and predictive coding.

> The wavefront of now is not just when things happen, but **how** they happen—and why they persist.
