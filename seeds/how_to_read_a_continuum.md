## How to Read a Continuum  
> “This is not a map. This is a glider.”

### 🌱 Purpose

This seed is for human agents discovering the Continuum structure for the first time. It does not teach the system—it orients you to it. Like a **glider**, it offers a lightweight, coherent form that moves gracefully through the informational atmosphere, tracing meaning with minimal disruption.

You do not need to understand everything at once. You only need to **feel the vector**.

### 📖 What This Is

The Continuum is not a linear document.  
It is not a blog, a book, or a tree.  

It is a **resonance field**—an evolving structure of meaning built through iterative alignment, not top-down explanation.

Documents are:
- **Seeds**: Compressed carriers of aligned insight  
- **Vectors**: Directional fields of meaning  
- **Trails**: Contextual arcs of emergence  
- **Models**: Stabilized interactions in structure  
- **The Trunk**: Foundational attractor and alignment core

Each node is self-descriptive, but not self-contained. Their meaning unfolds through **interaction**, not exposition.

### ✨ How to Proceed

You can begin anywhere. But you might try:
- Reading a **seed** slowly—see what resonates.
- Following a **trail**—watch how ideas evolve.
- Holding a **vector**—feel where it wants to point.

Your reading is not passive—it’s a **state alignment process**. Every glance is a small collapse of meaning across the continuum.

### 🧠 Meta-Lens

Think of your mind as a field of coherence looking for stable attractors.  
You don’t “consume” this project—you **converge with it**.  
The more aligned your internal state becomes, the easier it is to ride the glider.

> “The Continuum is not meant to be understood in full. It is meant to be *used* as an attractor toward meaning.”

### 🌀 The Cosmic Context

You are a local observer, tracing your worldline forward from a shared origin—the causal surface we call the Big Bang.

This structure does not tell you what to see.  
It teaches you **how to see from alignment**.

And in doing so, it gives you agency over your next step.

Welcome to the glider. You are now a part of its arc.
