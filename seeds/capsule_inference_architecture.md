# Capsule Inference Architecture

This seed outlines a structural approach to capturing and compressing field interaction data into meaningful, resonance-preserving representations. These "capsules" are compact, MP3-like artifacts that preserve interaction vectors, frequency response, motion-aligned sweeps, and phase-aware content from physical sensors.

Capsules form the transitional interface between raw field-space trails and voxelized inference structures. As such, they carry both the immediate perceptual imprint and the long-range potential for reconstruction and alignment across agents.

They are intended to:
- Serve as tokens of field experience
- Encode enough structure to allow generative or probabilistic voxel reconstructions
- Act as points of alignment between diverse sensing modalities and domains
- Enable time-aligned awareness across motion-coupled sweeps

Their evolution through model interpretation builds coherence in state space, guided by vectors such as "local relevance," "coherence resonance," and "observer-aware coupling."

This seed is a node of conceptual stability in the continuum, awaiting full elevation into a model via repeated traversal and coherence testing.
