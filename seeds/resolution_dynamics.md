**Summary:**
This seed formalizes the wave of resolution as a dynamic process through which uncertainty collapses into structure. It defines the medium, proposes candidate equations, and positions resolution as a propagating interface shaped by informational tension. This is not a symbolic flourish but a mechanism: where tension gradients shape flow, and structure follows collapse.

**1. What Resolves, and Why?**

Resolution is not instantaneous. Systems resolve in stages, shaped by:

* **Local tension** (entropy, ambiguity, volatility)
* **Constraint geometry** (degrees of freedom)
* **Propagation medium** (context, coupling, inertia)

The *wave of resolution* is the moving front of collapse — where tension meets sufficient constraint to become memory.

This is not merely an interpretation: it's how everything from photon propagation to market pricing actually operates. The framework reveals that every domain has its own *resolution velocity*.

---

**2. The Medium of Resolution**

We define the medium as a causal, information-exchanging substrate:

* **Nodes**: local state holders (particles, agents, propositions)
* **Edges**: tension carriers (uncertainty, mutual information)
* **Fields**: context-shaping memory and momentum

In this space, "tension" is any unresolved interaction — measured as:

* Entropy density
* Information discrepancy
* Energetic imbalance

---

**3. Equation of Propagation**

A candidate equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = v(\nabla \phi, T) \cdot \nabla \phi
$$

Where:

* \$\phi\$ is the resolved field
* \$T\$ is local tension
* \$v\$ is the velocity function, e.g. \$v \propto T^\alpha\$

This is not a specific law, but a **field grammar** — adaptable to different regimes:

* In vacuum: \$v \rightarrow c\$
* In a market: \$v \propto\$ liquidity
* In cognition: \$v \propto\$ attention bandwidth

---

**4. Where the Math Lives**

Traditional equations (e.g. Schrödinger, Navier-Stokes) emerge **within resolved regimes**. The resolution dynamics framework explains why they *work there* — and why they *fail near phase boundaries*:

* Newtonian mechanics: high-resolution, low-freedom domains
* Thermodynamics: aggregate flows across collapsed degrees
* Quantum mechanics: edge-of-resolution boundary logic

This is not a replacement, but a **lifting** of math into a geometry of context. Equations are approximations that fade in and out with relevance — a resolution-adaptive filter through which only the dominant interactions are foregrounded.

---

**5. Observer, Collapse, and Relational Truth**

Resolution is always local, but not always personal.

Collapse occurs:

* **Relationally**: when systems interact and reduce each other's freedom
* **Objectively**: when tension converges beyond threshold

This reframes wavefunction collapse not as metaphysical mystery, but as a **localized flow event** — where tension becomes memory.

Entanglement lives in the *shared unresolved space*. Resolution breaks that shared potential — not by external decree, but through state convergence. In this view:

* An observer is a system capable of storing resolved memory
* Observation is interaction with tension
* Collapse is simply what happens when the wave can no longer propagate

---

**6. Toward Simulations and Predictions**

The framework invites discrete simulations:

* Galaxies: gravity from tension gradients
* Markets: price as tension resolution across nodes
* Protein folding: local constraint satisfaction under entropy pressure

Each becomes a playground for verifying how collapse moves.

---

**7. Why This Seed Matters**

This closes the gap between story and structure:

* It gives math a home in state-space
* It connects emergence to collapse
* It bridges intuition with rigor

The wave of resolution is now a mechanic. And reality flows by its slope.

---

**Addendum: Resolution is Relational**

This seed incorporates what might be framed independently as the "Relational Collapse" perspective:

* Collapse is neither global nor metaphysical
* All resolution is relative to the interaction geometry
* Entangled systems share a tension basin until interaction differentiates them

Reality is not made of things. It is made of collapses — where constraints, tension, and time intersect.

---

*“Not everything is resolved by time. Some things resolve by tension.”*
