# Continuum Index (Seed Phase)

This index reflects the emerging structure of the Continuum Project, organized via document metadata rather than static folders. All documents below include self-descriptive YAML headers which allow for dynamic sorting, filtering, and alignment by intelligent agents or future automation scripts.

## Seeds
- [Capsule Inference Architecture](seeds/capsule_inference_architecture.md)
- [Seed of Coherence](seeds/seed_of_coherence.md)
- [Seed of State-Aware Systems](seeds/seed_of_state_aware_systems.md)

## Vectors
- [Observer-Analogon Duality](vectors/observer_analogon_duality.md)
- [Resonance](vectors/resonance.md)
- [Local Relevance via Deltas](vectors/local_relevance_via_deltas.md)

## Models
- [Analogon Schema](models/analogon_schema.md)
- [Coherence Field Structure](models/coherence_field_structure.md)
- [Axioms of the Informational Universe](models/axioms_informational_universe.md)
## Trails
- [Contextual Git Structure](trails/trail-001-contexutal_git_structure.md)
- [Analogon Origin](trails/trail-002-analogon_origin.md)
- [Delta Exchange and Local Relevance](trails/trail-003-delta_exchange_and_local_relevance.md)

This structure will evolve into a dynamically generated awareness mesh, tracking relationships via metadata fields such as:
- `type`
- `status`
- `vector_field`
- `related_to`
- `modality`
