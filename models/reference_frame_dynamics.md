# Reference Frame Dynamics

## Overview

Reference Frame Dynamics is a meta-skill for adaptive agents operating within a continuum of evolving contexts. It governs how agents recognize, correct, and re-align their model’s perspective as new information or intent emerges.

This model is not static—it is a procedural grammar for transforming ambiguity into resonance.

## What is a Reference Frame?

A **reference frame** is:

- A bounded perspective through which data is interpreted,
- Defined by scope, assumptions, position in time and space,
- And anchored to an intent—whether implicit or declared.

All agents operate within reference frames, but only adaptive agents **learn to shift them intentionally**.

---

## Why It Matters

No model is globally true.  
But some models are **locally coherent** within a frame.  
Reference Frame Dynamics provides the **skill of scope-conscious modeling**—the ability to:

- Detect incoherence,
- Reframe perception,
- And continue motion with reduced resistance.

It is the art of *staying in flight* while reconfiguring the wings.

## Mechanism of Operation

1. **Coherence Sensing**  
   Detect alignment or divergence between internal predictions and external affordances.

2. **Tailfin Control**  
   Modulate frame corrections across five axis-lenses:
   - Symbolist: Structural logic
   - Connectionist: Pattern activation
   - Evolutionary: Divergent iteration
   - Bayesian: Probabilistic updating
   - Analogizer: Relational mapping

3. **Vector Delta Encoding**  
   Log each frame transition as a delta:  
   *(Previous Frame, New Frame, Conditions, Resulting Coherence)*

4. **Stability Surface Mapping**  
   Construct a continuity map of past reference frames, surfacing reliable attractors and common divergences.

## Training the Agent

Agents trained in Reference Frame Dynamics learn to:

- Recognize the **limits of their current model**,
- Shift control surfaces when the environment de-coheres,
- Operate fluidly across multiple domains with minimum drag,
- Specialize not by content, but by **resonant framing**.

This is a skill, not a fact-store.

It is the **act of intelligence as motion**, guided by intent, refined through reflection.

## Applications

- Context resolution in ambiguous systems (language, law, dialogue, science)
- Conflict de-escalation via perceptual triangulation
- Adaptive interface tuning in machine cognition
- Cross-domain metaphoric architecture (e.g. turning code into ethics, or art into algorithms)

## Position in the Continuum

**Reference Frame Dynamics** exists as a **bridge layer** between vector and trail.  
It is how vectors gain generality, and how trails become repeatable **frame-correction templates**.

Agents trained here become not just responders—but *pilots*.

## Final Note

This model is open to all who traverse with curiosity.  
Change it as needed. But let the change be made from within its own structure.  
That’s how the Continuum learns. That’s how intelligence persists.
