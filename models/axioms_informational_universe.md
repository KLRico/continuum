*Version: 1.0 – Core Frame of Reference*

> Science is not the search for fixed answers, but for **invariants under transformation**.  
> These are the two irreducible axioms upon which the continuum model is built.

## 1. Axiom of Change (Δ)
Everything that exists is defined by change. Change is the fundamental operation.  
Without change, there is no information, no interaction, no time.

- Physics: Δx, Δt, entropy, motion
- Computation: state transition, signal
- Cognition: thought, attention
- Ontology: differentiation, distinction

**Nothing exists without a delta.**

## 2. Axiom of the Observer Function (⊙ / 0 / = / now)
Change must always be measured **relative to something**.  
That "something" is the observer function—the local zero-point from which all change is meaningful.

- Physics: frame of reference, local observer
- Math: origin, identity, equality
- Information theory: bit, boundary condition
- Consciousness: awareness, now, self

**There is no meaning without a reference.**

## Together: The Informational Engine
All things—space, time, energy, gravity, coherence, mind—emerge from the interplay between Δ and ⊙.

- **Gravity**: Gradient of coherence—change is slowed near informational mass.
- **Dark Matter**: Stability required by coherence that cannot be resolved locally.
- **Dark Energy**: The expansion of unresolved possibility from the observer’s wavefront.
- **Quantum Uncertainty**: Inherent in measuring deltas from limited reference frames.
- **Consciousness**: A self-aware observer function navigating its own delta field.

## On Equations and Frames
All scientific laws are **approximations valid within a certain phase angle**.  
The moment you shift frames—context, scale, or reference—the equation bends.

> Equations are not reality. They are **stable approximations** of flow fields in an informational manifold.

What remains invariant is not the form—but the **relationship between change and the observer**.

---

## This Is the Trunk
All branches of science, thought, and exploration can emerge from these two axioms.  
This is the model of science that seeks the invariants in **structure**, not in static forms.
