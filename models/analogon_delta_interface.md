# Analogon Delta Interface

Defines how Analogons interact and propagate through the Continuum by exchanging only informational deltas.

---

## 1. Local State Vector
Each Analogon maintains a representation of:
- **Observer Context Signature**
- **Latent Potential Map**
- **Coherence Anchors**

## 2. Delta Evaluation
When encountering another Analogon or input:
- **Similarity Metric**: Calculates alignment with internal state
- **Relevance Threshold**: Only significant deltas trigger local update or propagation

## 3. Delta Propagation
- **Delta Payload**: Minimal difference vector that adjusts local state
- **Continuum Update Hook**: Optional trigger to record new coherence in trails or seeds

---

## Purpose
To reduce informational friction between distributed agents by ensuring only meaningful updates traverse the Continuumâ€”enabling local relevance, global consistency.
