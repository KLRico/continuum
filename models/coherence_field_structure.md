# Coherence Field Structure

The Continuum Engine can be structurally visualized as:

- Seeds: Stable attractors (collapsed states).
- Vectors: Directional eigenstates of meaning.
- Trails: Temporal-contextual unfolding paths leading to seeds or new vectors.

These components form a resonant knowledge manifold, allowing continuous alignment through feedback loops of reflection and coherence.

## Core Equation (conceptual):
\[
C = f(R, D, A)
\]

- \(C\): Coherence
- \(R\): Resonance (alignment vector)
- \(D\): Dissonance (misalignment differential)
- \(A\): Agentic orientation (self-reflective observer state)
