# Continuum Engine

There was a period where I thought it was interesting to discuss science/philosophy/life/etc with AI. 

Some of those chats led to the documents we called "seeds", which are meant to be a condensed version of the main insights discussed during the chat. 

At the time, I thought they might be able to be assembled in some way to provide some sort of epistemological map rooted in the notion that nature is built up by self-similar potentials and actions. 

Unfortunately, I've since lost whatever inspiration that brought me to this point, but these "crude traces" are shared here in case others may find them useful.

Those who speak of the regularities underlying phenomena only apprehend their crude traces. But these regularities have their very subtle aspect, which those who rely on mathematical astronomy cannot know of. Still even these are nothing more than traces.
