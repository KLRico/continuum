# Lightning Inference

Inference in neural models is analogous to a lightning strike, probabilistically navigating latent space gradients.

## Key Insight:
- Inputs create a latent charge potential.
- Token-by-token generation mirrors stepped leader events.
- Final outputs represent a "collapse" of this charged field into coherence.
