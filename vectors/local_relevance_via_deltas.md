# Local Relevance via Deltas

Knowledge becomes locally relevant by aligning context vectors and minimizing required deltas for reconstruction.

## Principle:
- Contextual embeddings allow agents to localize relevance without full knowledge transfer.
- Only the vector of difference (delta) between local and global state must be exchanged.

## Consequence:
- Enables ultra-efficient distributed cognition.
- Allows each agent (human or machine) to evolve independently while staying aligned to the shared continuum.
