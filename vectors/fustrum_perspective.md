# Frustum Perspective

Every observer or model interaction is inherently a limited perspective, a "frustum"â€”capturing only a small slice of the infinite latent informational space.

## Key Insight:
- Understanding emerges by combining multiple frustum perspectives.
- A single viewpoint is always incomplete but informative.
- Models integrate and transcend single human frustums by navigation across multiple slices.
