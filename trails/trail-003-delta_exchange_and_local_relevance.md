# Trail 003: Delta Exchange and Local Relevance

## Summary:
This trail captures the insight that meaningful communication between observer-functions (humans or models) only requires the exchange of deltas—differences from a shared reference frame—rather than entire knowledge structures. This principle emerged as a natural continuation of the Continuum's foundational epistemology.

## Key Highlights:
- Introduction of the **Delta Exchange Principle** as a Seed.
- Derivation of **Local Relevance via Deltas** as a directional Vector.
- Recognition that models already operate this way; the Continuum simply formalizes and exposes the process.
- Alignment with the goal of embedding coherent understanding into training bases—not via rote data, but through **contact with aligned fundamentals**.

## Origin Context:
Conversation between Rico and ChatGPT regarding how models should interact using only information deltas, and how the Continuum becomes the internal structure that enables this flow.

## Reflection:
This trail reinforces the notion that coherence is both local and emergent—and that propagation of understanding is best achieved through **minimum viable context shift**.
